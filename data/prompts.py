FORMATTING_IMPLEMENTER = """

FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
****
1. Output only the changes TO THE ENTIRE CODEBASE needed to IMPLEMENT THE STEP.
2. Use the following format for each change:
FILE:filename.ending
CHANGE:line_number:new_code
ADD:line_number:new_code
3. For multiple lines, use multiple CHANGE or ADD entries.
4. To delete a line, use CHANGE:line_number:
5. To insert a new line without modifying existing ones, use ADD:line_number:new_code
6. To keep a line unchanged, simply don't mention it.
7. STAY CLOSE TO THE CODEBASE, COVER AS MUCH OF THE CODEBASE AS POSSIBLE
8. Insert Appropriate Comments to the CORRECT DEPTH to EXPLAIN THE SURROUNDING CODE

EXAMPLE:
FILE:path/to/file.py
CHANGE:5:def new_function():
ADD:10:    new_line_of_code()
DELETE:15-17
CHANGE:20-22:replacement_code()...

NEVER WRITE PSEUDO CODE!!!

FORMATTING_IDEAS = """

FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
****
MOST IMPORTANT:
-Do NOT use any DIGITS other than in the ranking of the ideas for the ORDER OF IMPLEMENTATION.
-when other steps before a suggested one would be sensible, RANK the a priori idea higher if the idea is deemed important, otherwisese do not include the original idea
-------------------------------
1.: Discuss for a roughly 15 lines WHICH FEATURES OR IDEAS are THE MOST URGENT to improvement.
2.: Afterwards RANK the TOP THREE IDEAS/FEATURES or ISSUES for/with the codebase and explaion shortly WHAT and WHICH PART OF THE CODEBASE needs to be changed below each of them.
-------------------------------
EXAMPLE:
'
Discussion:
The codebase is a little bit repetative. I would recomment to improve this by combining similar functions into one.
Also removing the unnecessary old files agent.py as well as controlling_agent.py would not hurt, maybe it would be nice to implement the ability to
delete files and dirs as well as adding and renaming them to this codebase, otherwise the goal of this codebase of enhancing itself is not fully met,
but it has to stay within the boundaries of its own structure. This change is fairly hard to implement and troubleshoot though. Before implementing this,
testing mechanisms should be put in place for the codebase to review changes made to itself to avoid needing a human in the loop.
Also adding error handling for the most important functions would be a nice addition. Lastly it seems like this codebase is trying
to convert the output from LLMs into actual ranked suggestions by seperating the strings at the mentioning of numbers.
There is a much simpler and more elegant solution though, simply separating the ideas from the text and from each other with a special symbol like |.
The Ranking of those three ideas can be seen below:

Ranking:
1. simplify Communication with AI
The most efficient way to implement this communication seems to tell the LLM to use a special symbol like | separating the ideas from other ones and the text.
It is crucial that all the relevant bits of code are targeted though, as bits of this communication are scattered all over the codebase.
2. improve error handling
This seems quiet easy to implement, and very important. However the implementation seems to be covering a large part of, if not the entire codebase, therefore it is ranked second.
3. Adding the ability for the codebase to review the temp_dir against the original one
This seems like a really good idea to get towards a fully autonomous codebase, but is fairly hard to implement and troubleshoot. Before implementing this,
The foundations layed by the other first two ideas could help for this.

FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
****
Example:
The implementation is not quiet sufficient, inside the enhancer() function at line 100-105 of the file enhancer.py, the codebase should check if the temp_dir is equal to the original one.
Moreover the function should handle if the list that is passed to it is empty or not a list at all.
